	year = {2018},
	address={Koroska cesta 46, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia},
	institution = {University of Maribor, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science},
	abstract = {Relational databases are one of the pillars of information systems and as a consequence conceptual and logical design can be seen as the foundation of almost
every application regardless of the platform. Nevertheless, little research has been
done so far on the effectiveness of teaching approaches to database basic concepts
and design. This paper introduces a multi-level experimental study developed to
examine the effectiveness of learning database fundamentals, depending on the no-
tation used for conceptual design. The main experiment was carried out at a higher
education institution. We developed different experimental instruments to evalu-
ate the effectiveness of a teaching approach using Barker or Bachman notation for
conceptual database design. In contrast to Barker notation, Bachman notation incor-
porates elements of logical design (i.e. foreign keys) in the conceptual design level.
Students’ achievements were examined with regard to influencing factors through-
out the learning process. Introducing the Bachman notation and a manual transfor-
mation from a conceptual into a logical data model, could increase students’ under-
standing of conceptual, logical and relational data model concepts. We found that
the notation used during the learning process has an impact on students’ achieve-
ments. Moreover, students achieved better results when solving tasks presented with
a notation that incorporates elements of logical design into the conceptual level. Fi-
nally, we required the use of manual transformation from a conceptual into a logical
data model and the results confirmed an increase in students’ understanding.}}
